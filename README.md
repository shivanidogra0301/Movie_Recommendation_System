# Movie_Recommendation_System
A machine-learning based movie recommendation engine integrated with React.js and Flask. 
A complete website with working backend.

### Movie Recommendation Model
The algorithm used in this model is Hybrid Filtering which is the combination of two recommender system. It combines the strengths of more than two Recommender system and also eliminates any weakness which exist when only one recommender system is used.
The two algorithm used are
- <strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong> :It measure the similarity between target users and other users. The key idea behind CF is that similar users share the same interest and that similar items are liked by a user.
- <strong>Content Filtering</strong> : A content-based recommender learns a profile of the new userâ€™s interests based on the features present.In a content-based recommender system the algorithms used are such that it recommends users similar items that the user has liked in the past or is examining currently.
